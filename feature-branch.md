## Introduction

This document is part of the **Branching Strategy** initiative and focuses on the **Feature Branch Workflow**—a widely adopted Git branching model. In this approach, each feature or bug fix is developed in a separate branch, isolated from the main codebase. This enables teams to work in parallel, reduce conflicts, ensure clean code reviews, and maintain a stable main branch. The document outlines what it is, why it's used, how it works, key features, and its pros and cons.

## What is Feature Branch Workflow

Feature Branch Workflow is a Git branching model where each new feature is developed in a dedicated branch isolated from the main production branch. Once the feature is complete and tested, it is merged back into the main or development branch, typically via a pull request or merge request.

## Key Features

| Feature               | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Isolated Development  | Each feature is developed in its own branch                            |
| Supports Code Reviews | Encourages pull/merge requests for collaborative reviews               |
| Safer Integration     | Features are only merged after they pass tests and reviews             |
| Better Collaboration  | Multiple team members can work independently without disrupting others |
| Easier Reverts        | Bugs can be traced and reverted with minimal impact                    |

## Why Use Feature Branch Workflow

Using a feature branch workflow allows teams to develop, test, and review features independently. It reduces the risk of breaking the main codebase, enables parallel development, and improves code quality through peer review.

## Workflow Diagram

**Explanation of the Diagram:**

* The **master** branch contains production-ready releases and is updated only when a new stable version is deployed.
* The **develop** branch is used for integrating features and serves as the active development line.
* Individual **feature branches** are created from develop and represent specific features or bug fixes being worked on.
* After development and review, the feature branches are merged back into develop.
* When a release milestone is achieved (e.g., `v0.2`, `v1.0`), the code from develop is merged into master.

This structure enables a clean, organized, and collaborative way to manage parallel development while maintaining code stability and traceability.

## Advantages

| Advantage             | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parallel Development  | Multiple features can be developed simultaneously         |
| Improved Code Quality | Reviews and tests before merging reduce bugs              |
| Simple Rollbacks      | Easier to revert a feature branch if something goes wrong |
| Organized Repository  | Clear history of what each feature branch introduced      |

---

## Disadvantages

| Disadvantage               | Description                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Merge Conflicts            | Long-lived branches may face difficult conflicts |
| Delayed Integration        | Too much delay in merging can make sync harder   |
| Overhead in Review Process | Requires consistent review discipline from teams |

---

## Conclusion

Feature Branch Workflow offers a structured and scalable way to manage parallel development in a collaborative environment. While it introduces some review overhead, its benefits in code quality, flexibility, and rollback capabilities make it a popular choice for modern teams.
