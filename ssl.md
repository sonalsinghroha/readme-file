## Introduction

This document is part of the **Network Security Best Practices** initiative and focuses on documenting and implementing **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)** certificates to ensure encrypted, secure communications over the internet. SSL is essential in protecting sensitive data during transmission and is widely used for websites, APIs, mobile apps, and enterprise systems. The document covers what SSL is, why it is important, how it works, how to acquire and implement an SSL certificate, major providers, and a comparison to help make informed decisions.

## What is SSL?

**SSL (Secure Socket Layer)**, succeeded by **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**, is a cryptographic protocol that encrypts communication between a client and server. Although TLS is the current standard, SSL is still commonly referred to in the industry.

## Features of SSL

| Feature               | Description                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encryption            | Secures data transmission with strong encryption protocols    |
| Identity Verification | Validates website ownership or organizational identity        |
| Integrity             | Ensures data is not altered during transfer                   |
| Compatibility         | Works across all major browsers and operating systems         |
| Flexibility           | Supports single-domain, multi-domain, wildcard configurations |
| Scalability           | Easily integrates with CDNs and cloud infrastructure          |

## Why SSL is Important

| Reason                  | Description                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Protection         | Encrypts sensitive data in transit to prevent interception |
| Authentication          | Confirms the identity of the server or website             |
| Trust Indicators        | Displays HTTPS and a padlock icon in browsers              |
| SEO Benefits            | SSL-enabled websites get better search engine rankings     |
| Compliance Requirements | Necessary for standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR      |

## How SSL Works

| Step | Action                                                               |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Client sends a "Hello" request to the server                         |
| 2    | Server responds with its SSL certificate and supported cipher suites |
| 3    | Client verifies certificate using trusted Certificate Authority (CA) |
| 4    | Session key is securely generated and exchanged                      |
| 5    | Encrypted communication begins using symmetric encryption            |

## How to Get an SSL Certificate

| Step | Description                                                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Choose a trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., DigiCert, Sectigo) |
| 2    | Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on your web server  |
| 3    | Submit the CSR and complete domain/org validation                |
| 4    | Receive and install the SSL certificate                          |
| 5    | Test installation using SSL checker tools                        |

## Types of SSL Certificates

| Type                        | Use Case                              | Validation Level        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Domain Validated (DV)       | Personal sites, blogs                 | Basic Domain Check      |
| Organization Validated (OV) | Company websites                      | Business Identity Check |
| Extended Validation (EV)    | Banking, e-commerce                   | Comprehensive Review    |
| Wildcard SSL                | Securing subdomains under one domain  | Varies                  |
| Multi-Domain (SAN) SSL      | Securing multiple domains             | Varies                  |
| Self-Signed Certificate     | Internal testing and development only | Not trusted publicly    |

## Recommendations

* Use **Let's Encrypt** for non-critical or short-term projects due to its free and automated nature.
* Choose **OV/EV Certificates** for e-commerce or finance websites.
* Prefer **DigiCert or GlobalSign** for large-scale or compliance-heavy applications.
* Document and automate certificate renewal processes to avoid downtime.
* Use monitoring tools to track certificate expiry and validity.
