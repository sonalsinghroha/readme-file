## Introduction

This document is part of the **VCS Authn & Authz Strategy** and outlines the **Notification Concept** used in Version Control Systems (VCS). Notifications in VCS help teams stay informed about key events such as commits, merges, permission changes, and access violations. They ensure timely communication and transparency within collaborative environments.

## What are VCS Notifications

VCS Notifications are automated messages triggered by events occurring within a version control system. These alerts inform users and teams about relevant actions or changes, allowing them to respond, approve, or take corrective actions. They are critical for maintaining transparency, coordination, and policy enforcement.
